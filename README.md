ðŸ“– How It Works
Architecture Overview
BasicBot Class
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__()           # Initialize with API credentials
â”œâ”€â”€ _test_connection()   # Verify API connectivity
â”œâ”€â”€ Market Orders        # Instant execution
â”œâ”€â”€ Limit Orders         # Price-specific execution
â”œâ”€â”€ Stop-Limit Orders    # Conditional execution
â”œâ”€â”€ Order Management     # Status, cancel, view
â””â”€â”€ Account Info         # Balance and positions
Order Types Explained
1. Market Order

Executes immediately at current market price
Best for: Quick entry/exit, high liquidity scenarios
Example: Buy 0.001 BTC at whatever the current price is

2. Limit Order

Executes only at specified price or better
Best for: Getting better prices, patient trading
Example: Buy 0.001 BTC only if price drops to $60,000

3. Stop-Limit Order (Bonus)

Triggers a limit order when stop price is reached
Best for: Stop-losses, breakout trading
Example: If BTC drops to $59,000 (stop), sell at $58,900 (limit)

 Usage Examples
Example 1: Place a Market Buy Order
Select option: 1
Enter symbol: BTCUSDT
Enter side: BUY
Enter quantity: 0.001
Confirm? yes
Example 2: Place a Limit Sell Order
Select option: 2
Enter symbol: ETHUSDT
Enter side: SELL
Enter quantity: 0.01
Enter limit price: 3500
Confirm? yes
Example 3: Set a Stop-Loss with Stop-Limit
Select option: 3
Enter symbol: BTCUSDT
Enter side: SELL
Enter quantity: 0.001
Enter stop price: 59000    # Triggers when price hits this
Enter limit price: 58900   # Executes at this price
Confirm? yes
 Understanding the Logs
The bot creates timestamped log files: trading_bot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
Log levels:

INFO - Normal operations (orders placed, prices checked)
WARNING - Non-critical issues (symbol not found)
ERROR - Failed operations (API errors, invalid orders)

Sample log entry:
2025-10-02 10:30:45 - INFO - Placing MARKET BUY order for 0.001 BTCUSDT
2025-10-02 10:30:46 - INFO - Market order placed successfully!
2025-10-02 10:30:46 - INFO - Order ID: 123456789
2025-10-02 10:30:46 - INFO - Status: FILLED
ðŸ”§ Code Structure Explanation
Key Components
1. Initialization & Connection
pythonbot = BasicBot(api_key, api_secret, testnet=True)

Sets up Binance client
Configures testnet URL
Tests connection
Logs account information

2. Order Placement Functions

Each order type has its own method
Validates inputs before submission
Logs all API requests and responses
Returns order details or None on failure

3. Input Validation
pythonvalidate_input(prompt, input_type, validator)

Type checking (string, float, int)
Custom validation rules
Error handling for invalid inputs
Keyboard interrupt support

4. Error Handling

Try-except blocks on all API calls
Specific handling for BinanceAPIException
Detailed error logging
User-friendly error messages

  Best Practices Demonstrated

Separation of Concerns: Each function has one clear purpose
Comprehensive Logging: All actions are logged with timestamps
Input Validation: All user inputs are validated before processing
Error Handling: Graceful failure with informative messages
Code Documentation: Clear docstrings for all functions
User Confirmation: Critical actions require explicit confirmation
Testnet Safety: Defaults to testnet to prevent accidental live trading

   Common Issues & Solutions
Issue 1: "API connection failed"
Solution: Verify your API key and secret are correct, and your IP is whitelisted on Binance Testnet
Issue 2: "Insufficient balance"
Solution: Go to Binance Testnet and request test USDT from the faucet
Issue 3: "Symbol not found"
Solution: Use correct symbol format (e.g., BTCUSDT not BTC-USDT)
Issue 4: "Order would immediately trigger"
Solution: For limit orders, ensure buy price is below current price and sell price is above
